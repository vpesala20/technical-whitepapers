# 📘 Technical Whitepapers Portfolio

This repository contains a curated collection of **four technical whitepapers**, each connecting my undergraduate foundation in **Electronics & Communication Engineering (ECE)** with my graduate specialization in **Machine Learning, Cloud Computing, and Systems Engineering**.

These papers demonstrate my ability to:

* Explain complex technical concepts clearly
* Combine engineering rigor with modern AI/cloud technologies
* Design large-scale, reliable systems
* Apply theory to real-world, industry-relevant use cases
* Produce professional-quality academic documents with citations

All papers follow **MLA formatting**, include **figures, diagrams, and structured sections**, and are suitable for **recruiters, hiring managers, and technical reviewers** evaluating my capabilities.
